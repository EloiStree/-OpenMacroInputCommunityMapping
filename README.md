# Open Macro Input Community Mapping

Wecome to you visitor.
OMI is a group of toolboxes that allows to tigger actions based on condition(s).

All the configuration is based on files structure to be able to be shared easily.

This repositroy is my first attempt to make the users of the toolboxes share to other users what they created.


**My aim would be to have three parts:**

- Compilation
  - Folder that try to compile the best of the community proposition.
- Per user
  - Folder specific to user (but review before added)
- Producer
  - Proposed by the team of the target tool
  - Accepted by the team of the target tool
